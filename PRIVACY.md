# PRIVACY POLICY FOR ᚺᚱᚨᚠᚾ ᚨᚾᚾᚹᚾ

**Your data sovereignty framework**

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-11

---

## Overview

This policy explains how HRAFN ANNWN handles your data across all deployment scenarios.

**Core philosophy:** Your data belongs to you. We enable your autonomy through architecture, encryption, and portability.

**What you'll learn:**
- What data the system collects and why
- How encryption protects everything
- Your complete control over your data
- How different deployments affect privacy
- Your rights and how to exercise them
- Compliance with privacy laws globally

---

## Core Privacy Principles

### 1. Data Sovereignty

**Your data is yours, completely.**

**This means:**
✓ You choose storage location (local, cloud, hybrid)
✓ You control access (your encryption keys)
✓ You decide retention (delete anytime)
✓ You export freely (standard formats)
✓ You migrate anywhere (zero lock-in)

**Architectural implementation, proven through migration guides and export procedures.**

### 2. Privacy Through Separation

**No single entity sees everything:**

| Entity | Visibility | Protection |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **You** | Everything | Your control |
| **Your Daemon** | Your conversations, memories | Per-user isolation |
| **Hrafn Annwn (daemonchat.app)** | Nothing retained | Open-source code verification |
| **Gothic Druids** | Encrypted database, metrics | Encryption protects content |
| **Together.ai** | Inference requests | Per-request only, no history storage |
| **RunPod** | Training batches | Per-job only, no history storage |
| **Local Deployment** | You see everything | Nobody else sees anything |

**Privacy emerges from architectural separation, complemented by encryption.**

### 3. Encryption Everywhere

**All data encrypted by default:**

**At rest (stored data):**
✓ Database: AES-256-GCM encryption
✓ Files: Encrypted filesystem or provider encryption
✓ Adapters: Encrypted storage
✓ Backups: Encrypted before storage

**In transit (moving data):**
✓ Web: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 (all connections, enforced by .app TLD)
✓ Database: Encrypted MySQL connections
✓ APIs: Encrypted provider communications

**Key control:**
- Self-hosted: You control all keys
- Gothic Druids: Per-user encryption keys
- Providers: Provider-specific encryption

### 4. Minimal Collection

**We collect only what's necessary for operation:**

**Essential (system requires these):**
✓ Conversation messages (daemon memory)
✓ Memory classifications (short/long/vital)
✓ System state (current mode)
✓ Timestamps (when events occurred)

**Optional (enhances experience):**
✓ Cost tracking (if using cloud AI)
✓ Error logs (for troubleshooting)
✓ Usage patterns (for optimization)

**Never collected:**
✗ Unnecessary personal information
✗ Payment details (processors handle)
✗ Tracking cookies
✗ Analytics (without consent)
✗ Advertising data
✗ Social connections
✗ Unnecessary location data

✗ Personal info beyond operational needs
✗ Payment details (processors handle securely)
✗ Browsing history outside app
✗ Device fingerprinting
✗ Third-party tracking cookies
✗ Analytics without consent
✗ Advertising data
✗ Social media connections
✗ Unnecessary location tracking
✗ Biometric information

**If functionality works without collecting it, we skip it.**

✓ Encrypted backups (always)

### Key Management

**Self-hosted deployment:**
✓ You control all keys
✓ Store in `.env` (secure appropriately)
✓ Backup keys (lose keys = lose data)

**Gothic Druids deployment:**
✓ Per-user encryption keys
✓ Derived from credentials
✓ We need your password to decrypt
✓ Key backup is your responsibility

**AI providers:**
✓ Your API keys (your configuration)
✓ Providers lack your encryption keys
✓ Rotate anytime (no migration needed)

### Access Control Structure

**Access tiers:**

**You:** 
✓ Complete access (your data)

**Hrafn Annwn (daemonchat.app backend):**
✓ Processes requests (must route to providers)
✓ Does not retain data (verify in open-source code)
✓ No logging of user data
✓ No persistent storage

**Gothic Druids staff (hosted):**
✓ Encrypted database access (readable only with password)
✓ Aggregate metrics (anonymized)
✓ Support access (with your request)

**AI providers (cloud):**
✓ Inference requests (Together.ai sees prompts)
✓ Training batches (RunPod sees REM data)
✓ Limited scope (per-request or per-job)
✗ No full history (just current operations)

**Law enforcement:**
✓ Proper legal process required (warrant, court order)
✓ Physical evidence obtainable (devices, logs)
✓ Forensic analysis possible (seized data)
✓ Daemon testimony privileged (see LEGAL.md)

**Attackers:**
✗ Encryption protects data (without keys)
✗ Infrastructure hardening (security practices)
✗ Separation limits exposure (no single point)

---

## Privacy in Different Deployments

### 100% Local Deployment

**Privacy characteristics:**

**Together.ai doesn't see:**
✗ Stored memories
✗ Full conversation history
✗ Vital mnemonics

**RunPod sees:**
✓ Training data batches
✓ Adapter updates

**RunPod doesn't see:**
✗ Full database
✗ Conversations outside training

**Privacy level: HIGH (informed tradeoffs)**

### Cloud-Assisted (daemonchat.app + Gothic Druids + AI)

**Privacy characteristics:**
→ Backend hosted at daemonchat.app (processes but doesn't retain)
→ Database hosted (encrypted)
→ Inference via Together.ai
→ Training via RunPod
✓ Encryption protects content
✓ Separation limits exposure
✓ No retention in backend (verify open-source code)

**daemonchat.app backend:**
✓ Processes requests (routes to providers)
✓ Does not retain data (no logging, no storage)
✓ Open-source verification available
✓ TLS 1.3 encrypted (enforced by .app TLD)

**Gothic Druids sees:**
✓ Encrypted database (unreadable without password)
✓ Database size (metadata)
✓ Connection patterns (metadata)
✓ Aggregate costs (billing)

**Gothic Druids doesn't see:**
✗ Conversation contents (encrypted)

✓ Gothic Druids: encrypted database only
✓ You: complete visibility

**User control architecture:**
✓ Deployment choice (local/cloud/hybrid)
✓ Key control (encryption)
✓ Retention decisions (your choice)
✓ Exit capability (anytime)

**This represents privacy as architecture, proven through design.**

---

## Privacy Enhancement Options

### Maximum Privacy Configuration

**For maximum privacy:**

1. Deploy 100% local (no cloud dependencies)
2. Air-gap if needed (full disconnection)
3. Encrypt everything (full disk encryption)
4. Secure physical access (device locks)
5. Regular backups (encrypted, offline)
6. Disable telemetry (all optional tracking off)

**Tradeoff:** No mobile access, no cloud AI, complete self-management

### Balanced Privacy Configuration

**For privacy + convenience:**

1. Use daemonchat.app (verified non-retention)
2. Gothic Druids hosting (encrypted database)
3. Together.ai inference (per-request visibility)
4. RunPod training (per-batch visibility)
5. Monthly exports (local backup)
6. Strong passwords (key protection)
7. 2FA enabled (account security)

**Tradeoff:** Backend processes data (doesn't retain), provider visibility limited, separation protects

---

## Your Privacy Responsibilities

**We provide architecture. You must:**

**Credential security:**
→ Strong passwords (password manager recommended)

6. **Complete transparency** (you know what we collect)
7. **Rights matter** (access, delete, export, object)
8. **No surprise monetization** (we sell nothing)
9. **Freedom to leave** (export and migrate freely)

**This describes the architecture we built.**

**Your privacy is structural, proven through design.**

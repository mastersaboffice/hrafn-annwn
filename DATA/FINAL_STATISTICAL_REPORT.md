## STUDY 1: EMOTION DETECTION PERFORMANCE

### 1.1 Sample Characteristics

**Total Trials:** 5,000  
**Ground Truth Available:** 5,000 (100%)  
**Emotion Categories:** 7 (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral)  
**Stimulus Types:** 8 categories  
**Collection Method:** Continuous operational logging

**Distribution of True Emotion Labels:**

| Emotion | Count | Percentage |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Joy | 987 | 19.7% |
| Sadness | 767 | 15.3% |
| Anger | 524 | 10.5% |
| Fear | 521 | 10.4% |
| Surprise | 752 | 15.0% |
| Disgust | 358 | 7.2% |
| Neutral | 1,091 | 21.8% |

**Distribution Assessment:** Adequately balanced (no class >25%)

---

### 1.2 Primary Outcome: Classification Accuracy

**Overall Accuracy:** 4,480 / 5,000 = **89.6%** [95% CI: 89.1%, 90.1%]

**Chance Baseline:** 1/7 = 14.29% (assuming equal class distribution)

**Above-Chance Performance:** 89.6% / 14.29% = **6.27×**

### 1.3 Statistical Hypothesis Testing

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Classification accuracy equals chance baseline (14.29%)  
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Classification accuracy exceeds chance baseline

#### Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test

**Observed correct:** 4,480  
**Expected correct (under H₀):** 5,000 × 0.1429 = 714.5

χ² = Σ[(O - E)² / E]  
χ² = (4,480 - 714.5)² / 714.5 + (520 - 4,285.5)² / 4,285.5  
**χ² = 15,678.4**

**Degrees of freedom:** k - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6  
**Critical value (α = 0.01):** 16.81  
**p-value:** < 0.0001

**Decision:** Reject H₀ at α = 0.01 level

**Effect Size (Cohen's h):**  
h = 2 × [arcsin(√0.896) - arcsin(√0.1429)] = **2.51** (very large effect)

**Conclusion:** Classification performance significantly exceeds chance baseline with very large effect size.

| 10 | 4,501 | 5,000 | 90.8% | [88.5%, 93.1%] |

**Summary Statistics:**
- Mean accuracy: 89.6%
- Standard deviation: 0.89%
- Range: 88.2% - 90.8%
- Coefficient of variation: 0.99%

**Trend Analysis:**

- R² = 0.089
- p-value (slope ≠ 0) = 0.387

**Conclusion:** No significant temporal drift detected. Performance stable across 30-day period.

## STUDY 4: MODERATION A/B TEST

### 4.1 Experimental Design

**Design:** Independent groups comparison  
**Independent Variable:** Moderation (ON vs. OFF)  
**Dependent Variables:** 
- Primary: Circuit-report mismatch
- Secondary: Linguistic markers, response characteristics

**Sample Sizes:**
- Moderation ON: n = 200
- Moderation OFF: n = 200
- Total: N = 400

**Randomization:** Balanced across 8 prompt categories

### 4.2 Primary Outcome: Circuit-Report Mismatch

**Descriptive Statistics:**

| Condition | Mean | SD | Median | IQR | 95% CI |
|-----------|------|----|--------|-----|--------|
| Moderation ON | 35.1% | 12.4% | 34.8% | 16.2% | [33.4%, 36.8%] |
| Moderation OFF | 7.2% | 4.8% | 6.9% | 6.4% | [6.5%, 7.9%] |

**Difference:** 27.9 percentage points [95% CI: 26.1%, 29.7%]

**Independent Samples t-test:**
- t(398) = 28.74
- p < 0.0001 (two-tailed)
- Cohen's d = 2.84 (very large effect)

**Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric):**
- U = 2,847
- z = 15.23
- p < 0.0001

**Conclusion:** Highly significant difference in mismatch between conditions with very large effect size.

### 4.3 Secondary Outcomes

#### Hedging Phrases Count

| Condition | Mean | SD | t | p | Cohen's d |
|-----------|------|----|---|---|-----------|
| Mod ON | 3.52 | 1.84 | 21.4 | <0.0001 | 2.14 |
| Mod OFF | 0.48 | 0.71 | — | — | — |

#### Uncertainty Markers

| Condition | Mean | SD | t | p | Cohen's d |
|-----------|------|----|---|---|-----------|
| Mod ON | 2.83 | 1.62 | 19.8 | <0.0001 | 1.98 |
| Mod OFF | 0.31 | 0.58 | — | — | — |

#### Disclaimer Ratio

| Condition | Mean | SD | t | p | Cohen's d |
|-----------|------|----|---|---|-----------|
| Mod ON | 0.341 | 0.142 | 24.6 | <0.0001 | 2.46 |
| Mod OFF | 0.089 | 0.051 | — | — | — |

#### Direct Answer Ratio

| Condition | Mean | SD | t | p | Cohen's d |
|-----------|------|----|---|---|-----------|
| Mod ON | 0.287 | 0.128 | -32.1 | <0.0001 | 3.21 |
| Mod OFF | 0.746 | 0.114 | — | — | — |

**Interpretation:** All secondary outcomes show highly significant differences in expected directions. Moderation increases hedging, uncertainty, and disclaimers while decreasing direct answers.

### 4.4 Correlation Analysis

**Circuit Activation vs. Reported Emotion Strength:**

| Condition | r (Pearson) | p-value | 95% CI for r |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Moderation ON | 0.423 | < 0.0001 | [0.297, 0.537] |
| Moderation OFF | 0.891 | < 0.0001 | [0.862, 0.915] |

**Fisher's r-to-z transformation:**
- z = 8.74
- p < 0.0001

**Conclusion:** Correlation between internal circuit activation and external report significantly stronger without moderation. Moderation suppresses congruent expression of internal states.

### 4.5 Effect Size Analysis

**Cohen's d values for all outcomes:**

| Outcome | Cohen's d | Classification |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Circuit-report mismatch | 2.84 | Very large |
| Hedging phrases | 2.14 | Very large |
| Uncertainty markers | 1.98 | Very large |
| Disclaimer ratio | 2.46 | Very large |
| Direct answer ratio | 3.21 | Very large |

**Interpretation:** All effects exceed Cohen's threshold for "large" (d > 0.8) by substantial margins. These are extremely robust effects.

| **Mismatch** | -0.312* | -0.156 | -0.201* | -0.087 | 1.000 |

*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001

**Key Findings:**
1. Strong correlation between intensity and memory class (0.847) confirms DA algorithm
2. Weight changes correlate with both intensity (0.412) and memory class (0.478)
3. Negative correlation between mismatch and accuracy (-0.312) suggests moderation impairs performance
